# LEARNING HTML AND PRAC...
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
- Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
- Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
- Tip: Use only one <h1> per page - it represents the main topic or title.

Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
- Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
